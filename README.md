# 📞 Call Center Simulation – Queueing Theory Project

This project simulates a real-world call center using **M/M/s queueing models** to:
- Optimize customer wait times
- Model abandonment
- Balance staffing cost vs. customer satisfaction
- Simulate peak-hour traffic and daily variability

---

## 🚀 Features:
- Simulates arrivals and service using exponential distributions
- Tests multiple agent counts to meet SLA (95% wait ≤ 5 min)
- Models abandonment when customers wait too long
- Includes break scheduling for agents
- Cost optimization using wait + staffing costs
- 30-day performance variability simulation

---

## 📊 Tools Used:
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib

---

## 📂 Files Included:
- `Call_Center_Simulation.ipynb`: Full simulation notebook
- `Call_Center_Simulation_PPT.pptx`: Project presentation

---

## ✨ Outcome:
This project demonstrates how queueing theory and simulation can help make **data-driven staffing decisions** in call centers or similar service systems.
